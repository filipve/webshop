  These words form the core touchstones of We Dew Lawns, Inc., a multi-generational lawn care provider serving the greater Green Valley area since 1971. Although we are a completely fictional company formed to serve the basis for Eric L. Barnes and W. Jason Gilmore's book, <a href="http://easyecommerce.com" target="_blank">Easy E-Commerce Using Laravel and Stripe: Selling Products and Subscriptions</a>, owner Todd McDew (were he to actually exist) is proud to unveil this new company website, catering to both discerning homeowners desiring the highest level of lawn care service as well as DIYers wishing to purchase top quality lawn care products.
